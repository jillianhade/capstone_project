Branching off of the work done by Todd Schneider where he uncovered that out of the top ten characters, according to number of words spoken, only two of those were women. This got me thinking about gender disparity within the show. I want to look into gender representation on the show and see if I am able to predict it based on character language. Using natural language processing I will analyze raw text of spoken lines by character and create a model that tries to predict gender based on variables pertaining to language. My goal is to accurately predict gender from language and further our understanding of predictive learning.
